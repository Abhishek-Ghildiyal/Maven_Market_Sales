# Maven_Market_Sales


I led a comprehensive sales analysis project at Maven Market, focusing on various countries, including the USA, Mexico, and others. Using Excel, I conducted in-depth analyses of seasonal sales trends, customer segments, and product performance across different regions. Advanced functions and pivot tables were employed to identify top-selling products and high-value customers, providing insights specific to each country, which helped refine localized sales and marketing strategies.

In Power BI, I developed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics, such as sales growth, customer behavior, and regional product performance. These country-specific dashboards empowered stakeholders to easily compare trends across the USA, Mexico, and other regions, supporting data-driven decisions and enhancing the companyâ€™s global marketing and sales efforts
